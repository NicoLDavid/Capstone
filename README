Canadian Forest Fires: A Quick Look at the Problem and Data

Introduction: 
Forest fires have far-reaching consequences, impacting both human lives and the
environment by causing widespread destruction and depleting natural resources. These
devastating events have gained global attention due to their significant impact. Having
resided in Canada for the past 15 years, I have personally witnessed how forest fires affect
various aspects of life, regardless of proximity to the fire zone. While forest fires are not a
new phenomenon, their severity appears to have escalated in the past decade. Exploring
avenues to minimize the severity and repercussions of these events presents a potential
opportunity.

Accurate prediction of forest fire risk holds immense value for residents living within
affected areas letting them to proactively assess their vulnerability. Government entities can
leverage such data to make informed decisions on resource allocation, risk mitigation
strategies, and comprehensive planning, ensuring efficient and effective response efforts.
Insurance corporations can utilize predictive insights to analyze the risk landscape in
specific regions. Health organizations can anticipate and address potential health concerns
arising from the fires themselves or from associated factors like smoke pollution. The
transportation sector can strategize by considering possible route closures, devising
alternative routes, and planning supply chain adjustments. Despite the collaborative efforts
of multiple government entities in combating these immense fires, the scale of the challenge
often surpasses the available resources, emphasizing the critical need for proactive
measures and advanced predictive capabilities.

Machine learning is currently employed in monitoring vast land areas, analyzing
emission data to gather information about potential new fires. A promising opportunity lies
in leveraging machine learning to forecast the location and intensity of forest fires,
facilitating efficient resource allocation and strategic planning for future events. This
approach would enable government entities to proactively initiate early mitigation
strategies, particularly in crucial areas identified as high-risk zones.
Historical data from National Resources Canada and Government of Canada for
wildfires and weather are publicly available. The wildfire data is classified by location, date,
cause, and severity. There is a separate file that maps out the affected area for each wildfire.
The dataset contains 400k instances spanning 1930 to 2021. The climate data provides
information based on location for temperature and precipitation broken down into different
classifications. Merging both datasets should provide enough features to do a thorough
analysis. There are also 400,000 instances in the wildfire data. Below are the links to both
datasets.
